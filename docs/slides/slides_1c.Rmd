# Overview

class: onecol
## Motivation

There are **several steps** in the machine learning workflow.

These include data exploration, engineering, model development, and evaluation.

We have a .imp[finite amount of data] to work with for each of these tasks.

--

<p style="padding-top:30px;">Reusing the same data for multiple tasks increases risk of .imp[overfitting].

## (a brief reminder about overfitting)

## Motivation

There are **several steps** in the machine learning workflow.

These include data exploration, engineering, model development, and evaluation.

We have a .imp[finite amount of data] to work with for each of these tasks.

<p style="padding-top:30px;">Reusing the same data for multiple tasks increases risk of .imp[overfitting].

--

It also reduces **generalizability** to future datasets or prediction problems.

We may not get a **true understanding** of our model's accuracy or effectiveness.

class: onecol
## A Data Budget

.left-column.pv3[
```{r spending, echo=FALSE}
include_graphics('../figs/spending.jpg')
```
]

.right-column[

Rather than using all available data at once, in ML we need to think about **budgeting** our data for different tasks. 

This is especially important when moving from **model development** into **model evaluation**.

Importantly, in smaller datasets, we might have to spend the same data on multiple tasks.

We need strong methods for doing so while minimizing the risk for overfitting our models!
]

---
class: onecol
## Avoiding Data Leakage

.left-column.pv3[
```{r, echo=FALSE}
include_graphics('../figs/leak.jpg')
```
]

.right-column[

All datasets contain a mix of the true *data-generating process* and random noise.<sup>1</sup>

The modeling process includes many decision points, and there is a risk of .imp[leaking information] from model training to evaluation.

This can artificially **inflate optimism about model accuracy**.

Carefully spending our data for model training vs. model can help prevent .imp[data leakage].

]

.footnote[
[1] *Data generating process* refers to the signal we want to capture - the underlying processes that gives rise to the data that we observe. *Random noise* refers to error (e.g., sampling error) we do not want to model.

# Countering Overfitting

---
class: onecol
## Cross-Validation
There are some clever algorithmic tricks to prevent overfitting

- For example, we can penalize the model for adding complexity

--

The main approach, however, is to use .imp[cross-validation]:

--

- Multiple **fully independent** sets of data are created (by subsetting or resampling)

- Some sets are used for training (and tuning) and other sets are used for testing

- **Model evaluation is always done on data that were not used to train the model**

- This way, if performance looks good, we can worry less about variance/overfitting

## Example Dataset: `titanic`

.pull-left[
**Rows:** 963 passengers&emsp;&emsp;**Columns:** 7 variables

Variable | Description
:------- | :----------
survived&emsp; | Did passenger survive? {FALSE, TRUE}&emsp; 
pclass | Passenger class {1st, 2nd, 3rd}
sex | Passenger sex {female, male}
age | Passenger age (years)
sibsp | Siblings and spouses Aboard (\#)
parch | Parents and children Aboard (\#)
fare | Cost of passenger fare ($)
]

.pull-right.pv4[
```{r}
library(readr)

# load titanic data
titanic <- read_csv(

```

## Simple Random Split

The simplest way to perform **holdout set validation** is by randomly splitting the data. 

One portion of the data is allocated for model training, and another for testing. 

Deciding on the proportion of data to split is very context-dependent.

--

<p style="padding-top:30px;">Too little data in the training set makes it difficult to **accurately estimate parameters**.

Too little data in the test set reduces **quality of model performance estimates**.

--

.bg-light-green.b--dark-green.ba.bw1.br3.ph4[
**Advice:** It is common to use 80% for training and 20% for testing.

class: onecol
## Simple Random Split in R

.left-column[
<br />
```{r, echo = FALSE}
include_graphics('../figs/rsample.png')
```
]

.right-column[
We will use the {rsample} package from {tidymodels}. 

The `initial_split()` function was built for this purpose.

Its simplest use case requires 2 arguments: 

- `data`: the dataframe to be split.
- `prop`: the proportion of data to be used for training.
]
 
---
class: onecol
## Simple Random Split in R
```{r, message = FALSE}
# set random seed so results are reproducible
set.seed(2022) 

# create and save an 80/20 data split
titanic_split_simple <- initial_split(data = titanic, prop = 0.80)
titanic_split_simple
```

--

<p style="padding-top:30px;">This output shows the amount of training, testing, and total data.

The resulting `initial_split` object **only contains partitioning information**.

---
class: onecol
## Simple Random Split in R

To get the actual training and testing data subsets, we need two more functions.

We will use the `training()` and `testing()` functions, also from {rsample}.

--

```{r, message = FALSE}
# create training and testing sets 
titanic_train_simple <- training(titanic_split_simple)
titanic_test_simple <- testing(titanic_split_simple)

dim(titanic_train_simple)
dim(titanic_test_simple)
```

---
class: onecol
## Stratified Sampling 

While simple random sampling is sometimes sufficient, there are often exceptions. 

**Class imbalance**<sup>1</sup> (classification) and highly **skewed data** (regression) may cause issues.

Most machine learning algorithms work best when classes are of equal size. 

.footnote[
[1] Class imbalance refers to a categorical variable in which one class occurs much more frequently than others (e.g., a dataset with 90% healthy cases and 10% disease cases).
]

--

<p style="padding-top:30px;"> Random sampling may result in vastly **different distributions** between data subsets.

This can result in poor model performance (particularly for the **minority class**). 

It is important for data subsets to be representative of the whole dataset.

---
class: onecol
## Stratified Sampling

As a solution, .imp[stratified sampling] can be used instead of simple random sampling. 

For classification problems, we conduct **data splits separately within each class**. 

For regression problems, we **bin the outcome into quartiles** and sample within each.

--

<p style="padding-top:30px;">These **stratified samples are combined** together for overall training and testing sets. 

This ensures that the **distribution of the outcome variable** is preserved.

--

.bg-light-yellow.b--light-red.ba.bw1.br3.ph4[
**Caution:** We still need to ensure the sample distribution matches the population!
]

---
class: onecol
## Stratified Sampling in R

To create a stratified random sample, we can use the same `initial_split()` function.

We will use the `strata` argument to name the variable to stratify on.

--

```{r, message = FALSE}
set.seed(2022)

# create initial stratified split
titanic_split_strat <- initial_split(data = titanic, 
                                     prop = 0.8, 
                                     strata = 'survived')

# create training and testing sets
titanic_train_strat <- training(titanic_split_strat)
titanic_test_strat <- testing(titanic_split_strat)
```

# Advanced Considerations

class: onecol
## What about Multilevel Data?

.left-column[
<br />
```{r, echo=FALSE}
include_graphics('../figs/multilevel.png')
```
]

--

.right-column[
Observations in multilevel data are not .imp[independent]. 

**Random resampling of rows** may cause biased train/test sets<sup>1</sup>.

Therefore, when working with multilevel data, resampling should occur at the **level of the experimental unit**.

In this example, resampling should be at the level of **hospitals**. 

We can use the `group_initial_split()` function in {rsample} to create an initial split of multilevel data.

]

.footnote[
[1] For example, some patients from hospital 1 may end up in the training set and others in the testing set.
]

---
class: onecol
## Splitting Multilevel Data in R

The `group_initial_split()` function has three main arguments:
- `data`: dataset

- `group`: group to split on (e.g., participants in an EMA study)

- `prop`: proportion of data to use for training

--

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# load EMA data 
ema <- readr::read_csv("https://tinyurl.com/ema-data-pm")

# initial split 
ema_split <- group_initial_split(covid_ema, group = "id", prop = 0.8)

# create training and testing datasets
ema_train <- training(ema_split)
ema_test <- testing(ema_split)
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# load data
ema <- readr::read_csv("https://tinyurl.com/ema-data-pm", col_types = cols(id = "f"), show_col_types = FALSE)

# initial split 
ema_split <- group_initial_split(covid_ema, group = "id", prop = 0.8)

# create training and testing datasets
ema_train <- training(ema_split)
ema_test <- testing(ema_split)
```

---
class: onecol
## Splitting Multilevel Data in R

.pull-left[
```{r, eval = FALSE}
# training data 
ema_train %>% select(id) %>% unique()
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
ema_train %>% 
  select(id) %>% 
  unique() %>% 
  kable() %>% 
  kable_styling(font_size = 25) %>% 
  scroll_box(height = "350px")
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r, eval = FALSE}
# testing data 
ema_test %>% select(id) %>% unique()
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
ema_test %>% 
  select(id) %>% 
  unique() %>% 
  kable() %>% 
  kable_styling(font_size = 25) %>% 
  scroll_box(height = "350px")
```
]

---
class: onecol
## What about Time Series Data?

.left-column[
<br />
```{r, echo=FALSE}
include_graphics('../figs/time.png')
```
]

.right-column[
Random resampling is also not appropriate for **time series data**.

We can't use .imp[data from the future] to predict data from the past! 

Instead, we should use the most **recent data** for a test set. 

When working with time series data, it's common to use the first portion of data for training, and the last portion for testing. 

We can use the `initial_time_split()` function in {rsample} to create an initial split of time series data.
]

---
class: onecol
## Splitting Time Series Data in R

The `initial_time_split()` function has three main arguments:
- `data`: dataset
- `prop`: proportion of first part of data for training
- `lag`: lag value if using lagged predictors 

.footnote[
Note: the `initial_time_split()` function assumes that your data are sorted in an appropriate order.
]

--

```{r}
# example: subset data to a single participant 
idiographic <- ema %>% filter(id == "user_2")

# initial split 
idiographic_split <- initial_time_split(idiographic, prop = 0.8, lag = 1)

# create training and testing datasets
idiographic_train <- training(idiographic_split)
idiographic_test <- testing(idiographic_split)

```

---
class: onecol
## Splitting Time Series Data in R

.pull-left[
```{r, eval = FALSE}
# training data 
idiographic_train
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
idiographic_train %>% 
  kable() %>% 
  kable_styling(font_size = 17) %>% 
  scroll_box(height = "350px")
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r, eval = FALSE}
# testing data 
idiographic_test
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
idiographic_test %>% 
  kable() %>% 
  kable_styling(font_size = 17) %>% 
  scroll_box(height = "350px")
```
]

## Coming Soon (Preview)

Today we reviewed the rationale for .imp[separating model training from model testing]. 

We learned various methods for **holdout set validation**: 
- Simple random split
- Stratified sampling
- Multilevel data
- Time series data

However, in practice, we might not want to limit ourselves to a **single test set**. 

What if we could create **multiple test sets** to evaluate our model many times? 

Tomorrow will cover advanced methods for **cross-validation**.
