## Geometry of Data

So far, we've modeled linear relationships with linear boundaries between classes, e.g.: 

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.showtext=TRUE}
set.seed(1)
x = rnorm(400)
y = rnorm(400)
simdat <- data.frame(x, y)
simdat$group_lin <- ifelse(simdat$x < simdat$y, 1, 0)

ggplot(simdat, aes(x, y)) + 
  geom_point(aes(color = group_lin)) +
  theme_xaringan(text_font_size = 14, title_font_size = 16) +
  theme(panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),
        panel.background = element_rect(fill = "white"),
        legend.position = "none")
```

---
class: onecol
## Geometry of Data

But what about other types of relationships? 

```{r, echo = FALSE}
simdat$group_circle <- ifelse(simdat$x < 1 & simdat$x > -1 & simdat$y < 1 & simdat$y > -1, 1, 0)

ggplot(simdat, aes(x, y)) + 
  geom_point(aes(color = group_circle)) +
  theme_xaringan(text_font_size = 14, title_font_size = 16) +
  theme(panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),
        panel.background = element_rect(fill = "white"),
        legend.position = "none")
```

class: onecol
## Geometry of Data

But what about other types of relationships? 

```{r, echo = FALSE}
simdat$group_quadrants <- ifelse((simdat$x < -0.5 & simdat$y > 0) | (simdat$x > 0.5 & simdat$y < 0), 1, 0)

ggplot(simdat, aes(x, y)) + 
  geom_point(aes(color = group_quadrants)) +
  theme_xaringan(text_font_size = 14, title_font_size = 16) +
  theme(panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),
        panel.background = element_rect(fill = "white"),
        legend.position = "none")
```

## Geometry of Data

These classes are very clearly separated.

However, we can't use a **single equation** to describe the boundaries between them.

# Classification Trees

class: onecol
## Building a Classification Tree

The goal of classification trees are to partition data into homogeneous groups.

This is defined by .imp[purity] (including more of one class than another class per node).

We use .imp[recursive partioning] to find data splits that maximize purity of each node.

--

<p style="padding-top:30px;">The .imp[Gini index]<sup>[1]</sup> is the most commonly-used metric for quantifying purity.

$$Gini = 1 - \sum\limits_{i = 1}^C(p_i)^2$$

where $p_i$ = the probability of being in the $i$th class and $C$ = total number of classes

.footnote[
The Gini index ranges from 0 - 1, with smaller values indicating greater purity.

## Building a Classification Tree

Let's walk through an example classification tree, with a toy depression risk dataset. 

Stressful Event&emsp; | Family History&emsp; | Age&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; | Depression Risk&emsp;
:------- | :-------- | :------- |:------- |
No | Yes | 10 | Low 
No | No | 12 | Low
Yes | Yes | 16 | High
Yes | Yes | 22 | High
No | Yes | 30 | High 
No | No | 38 | Low
Yes | No | 46 | Low

--

The first thing to do is choose the .imp[root node] (feature that best predicts depression risk). 

---
class: twocol
## Choosing the Root Node

.pull-left[
Start: find **Gini index** of stressful life events.

.imp[Stressful Event]&emsp; | Family History&emsp; | Age&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; | .imp[Depression Risk]&emsp;
:------- | :-------- | :------- |:------- |
.imp[No] | Yes | 10 | .imp[Low] 
.imp[No] | No | 12 | .imp[Low]
.imp[Yes] | Yes | 16 | .imp[High]
.imp[Yes] | Yes | 22 | .imp[High]
.imp[No] | Yes | 30 | .imp[High] 
.imp[No] | No | 38 | .imp[Low]
.imp[Yes] | No | 46 | .imp[Low]
]

--

.pull-right[
```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width="90%"}
include_graphics('../figs/stresstree.png')
```
]

class: twocol
## Choosing the Root Node

.pull-left[
Both terminal nodes are **impure**, with people having high and low depression risk.

## Choosing the Root Node
.pull-left[
Both terminal nodes are **impure**, with people having high and low depression risk.

We can quantify this impurity by calculating the **Gini index**.

In this case, the **Gini impurity** of `stressful life event` is 0.405.

To decide whether this variable should be our **root node**, we need to compare it to all other features in this dataset.
]

.pull-right[
```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width="90%"}

```
]

---
class: twocol
## Choosing the Root Node

We'll next calculate the Gini index for family history, which comes to:

.pull-left[
$Gini_{family} = 0.214$

Stressful Event&emsp; | .imp[Family History]&emsp; | Age&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; | .imp[Depression Risk]&emsp;
:------- | :-------- | :------- |:------- |
No | .imp[Yes] | 10 | .imp[Low] 
No | .imp[No] | 12 | .imp[Low]
Yes | .imp[Yes] | 16 | .imp[High]
Yes | .imp[Yes] | 22 | .imp[High]
No | .imp[Yes] | 30 | .imp[High] 
No | .imp[No] | 38 | .imp[Low]
Yes | .imp[No] | 46 | .imp[Low]
]

--

.pull-right[
```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width="90%"}
include_graphics('../figs/familytree.png')
```
]

---
class: twocol
## Choosing the Root Node

Calculating the Gini index for **numerical features** is slightly more complicated. 

We sort values from lowest to highest, calculate the midpoint of adjacent rows, and use these cutoffs to find the lowest Gini index. The lowest Gini index is for `age < 14.5` (Gini = 0.343): 

.pull-left[
Stressful Event&emsp; | Family History&emsp; | .imp[Age]&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; | .imp[Depression Risk]&emsp;
:------- | :-------- | :------- |:------- |
No | Yes | .imp[10] | .imp[Low] 
No | No | .imp[13] | .imp[Low]
Yes | Yes | .imp[16] | .imp[High]
Yes | Yes | .imp[22] | .imp[High]
No | Yes | .imp[30] | .imp[High] 
No | No | .imp[38] | .imp[Low]
Yes | No | .imp[46] | .imp[Low]
]

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width="90%"}

```
]

---
class: twocol
## Recursive Partioning

.pull-left[
Family history has the lowest Gini index of all features, so we set it as the root node. 

We then .imp[continue partioning the data] to find the next split from an impure node.

We can continue this process until we are left with .imp[only pure leaves]. 


Note: this is all done automatically in R! 

You don't need to make these calculations by hand, but it's helpful to have an understanding of how the algorithm works.

## Building a Regression Tree

Let's say we have data that look like this. How should we model these data? 

```{r, echo = FALSE}
set.seed(2021)
x <- seq(0, 11)

## Building a Regression Tree

We start with the entire data set $S$ to find the .imp[optimal feature and splitting value that partitions the data] into two groups $S_1$ and $S_2$. 

The goal is to minimize the sum of squared errors: 

$$SSE = \sum\limits_{i \in S_1}(y_i-\bar{y}_1)^2 + \sum\limits_{i \in S_2}(y_i-\bar{y}_2)^2$$

--

Within each group, we repeat recursive partitioning to find the next split.

The predicted value of a terminal node is the mean of all observations in that node. 

---
class: onecol
## Comprehension Check 

**Let's say we continued this recursive partioning process until we were left only with pure nodes (classification tree) or minimal SSE (regression tree). </br> </br> What are some problems that could arise?**

--

Some answers: 

- Overfitting training data

- Poor prediction on test data/future/new data
- Instability of model (if data are slightly altered, you may find entirely different splits)

- Small number of participants in leaves

- Selection bias: features with higher number of distinct values are favored

- Poorer interpretation

# Preventing Overfitting

## Preventing Overfitting

.pull-left[
Trees will continue to grow until each terminal node is entirely homogeneous.

This inevitably leads to **poor prediction** on testing data and any future datasets.

To prevent this, we need to **stop the algorithm at some point**, before it overfits. 

**Stopping criteria** can help us to prevent overfitting a decision tree.

.left-column.pv3[

.right-column[
Stopping criteria prevent trees from growing in certain conditions:

- Standard: if the leaf is homogenous (no need to split if the leaf is already homogenous).

- If the leaf has too few observations for another split.

What counts as "too few observations"?

This is a **hyperparameter** (`min_n` in {tidymodels}).

We can determine the optimal value of `min_n`  by tuning!

## Decision Trees Summary

A single tree has **excellent interpretability** and is easy to explain to people. 

Decision trees closely mirror the **human decision-making processes**! 

However, a single tree is typically **not flexible enough** to accurately predict new data. 

**Single trees are unstable**; they change dramatically with a small shift in training data.

<p style="padding-top:30px;">One solution is to .imp[aggregate predictions from many decision trees together]. 

This may help us **improve predictive accuracy and model stability**.

.right-column[
Random forests aim to combine the simplicity of a single tree with greater model **flexibility**. 

We do this by building **multiple decision trees**.

We then **aggregate their predictions** together for one final prediction. 

This is called an **ensemble method**. 

By using multiple trees (rather than just one), we can achieve greater **predictive accuracy** in new datasets.

However, this comes at the cost of **lower interpretability**.

## Random Forests Summary

Random forests are a .imp[powerful ML algorithm] that can model nonlinearity in data. 

By only using a random subset of features at each tree split, **RF trees are decorrelated**.

Aggregating many bootstrapped, uncorrelated trees is effective at **reducing variance**.

Random forests have .imp[higher accuracy but lower interpretability] than single  trees.

--

<p style="padding-top:30px;">When building random forests, tuning parameters include: 

- The number of features to consider at each split (`mtry`)

- The number of decision trees in the forest (`trees`)

- The minimum number of data points in a node required for another split (`min_n`)
