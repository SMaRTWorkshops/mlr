# Conceptual Introduction
---
class: onecol
## What is machine learning?

The field of machine learning (ML) is a **branch of computer science**

ML researchers **develop algorithms** with the capacity to .imp[learn from data]

When algorithms learn from (i.e., are **trained on**) data, they create **models**<sup>1</sup>

<p style="padding-top:20px;">This workshop is all about applying ML algorithms to create .imp[predictive models]</p>

The goal will be to **predict unknown values** of important variables **in new data**

.footnote[
[1] ML models are commonly used for prediction, data mining, and data generation.
]


---
class: twocol

.pull-left[
## Labels / Outcomes
Labels are variables we .imp[want to predict]<br />the values of (because they are unknown)

Labels tend to be expensive or difficult to measure in new data (though are known in some existing data that we can learn from)

AKA outcome, dependent, or $y$ variables

```{r label_icons, echo=FALSE}
include_graphics("../figs/label_icons.png")
```

]
--
.pull-right[
## Features / Predictors
Features are variables we .imp[use to predict]<br />the unknown values of the label variables

Features tend to be relatively cheaper and easier to measure in new data than labels (and are also known in some existing data)

AKA predictor, independent, or $x$ variables

```{r feature_icons, echo=FALSE}
include_graphics("../figs/feature_icons.png")
```

]

---
class: twocol

## Modes of Predictive Modeling
.pull-left[
When labels have continuous values, predicting them is called .imp[regression]

```{r regression_diagram, echo=FALSE}
include_graphics("../figs/regression_diagram.png")
```

- *How much will a customer spend?*
- *What GPA will a student achieve?*
- *How long will a patient be hospitalized?*
]
--
.pull-right[
When labels have categorical values, predicting them is called .imp[classification]

```{r classification_diagram, echo=FALSE}
include_graphics("../figs/classification_diagram.png")
```

- *Is an email spam or non-spam?*
- *Which candidate will a user vote for?*
- *Is a patient's glucose low, normal, or high?*
]

.footnote[*Unsupervised learning* (AKA data mining) has no explicit labels and just looks for patterns within the features.]

# Signal and Noise
---
class: onecol

## A Delicate Balance

Any data we collect will contain a mixture of **signal** and **noise**

- The "signal" represents informative patterns that generalize to new data
- The "noise" represents distracting patterns specific to the original data

We want to capture as much signal and as little noise as possible

--

<p style="padding-top:30px;">More complex models will allow us to capture <b>more signal</b> but also <b>more noise</b></p>

.imp[Overfitting]: If our model is too complex, we will capture unwanted noise

.imp[Underfitting]: If our model is too simple, we will miss important signal

What makes machine learning so amazing is<br />
its **ability to learn complex patterns**

However, with this great power and flexibility<br />
comes the looming **danger of overfitting**

Thus, much of ML research is about finding ways<br />
to **detect** and **counteract** overfitting

For detection, we need *at least* two sets of data:

## Conclusions from Example
In ML, .imp[bias] is a lack of predictive accuracy in the original data (the "training set")

In ML, .imp[variance] is a lack of predictive accuracy in new data (the "testing set")

--

.pt1[
An ideal predictive model would have both low bias and low variance

However, there is often an inherent **trade-off between bias and variance**<sup>1</sup>

.footnote[[1] To increase our testing set performance, we often need to worsen our performance in the training set.]

.pt1[
We want to find the model that is **as simple as possible** but **no simpler**

## Comprehension Check \#3
<span style="font-size:30px;">Sam used all emails in his inbox to create an ML model to classify emails as "work-related" or "personal." Its accuracy on these emails was 98%.</span>

.pull-left[
### Question 1
**Is Sam done with this ML project?**

a) Yes, he should sell this model right now!

b) No, he needs to create a training set

c) No, he needs to test the model on new data

d) No, his model needs to capture more noise

.pull-right[
### Question 2
**Which problems has Sam already addressed?**

a) Overfitting

b) Underfitting

c) Variance

d) All of the above

## Activity: Icebreakers

.f4[
In the Slack **\#general** channel, post a brief introduction about yourself and react to at least one other attendee's post (e.g., with an emoji or by "replying in thread" with a message).

#### Possible Inclusions:

- Where are you joining us from?
- What discipline are you in and what topics do you study?
- What problems do you want to apply machine learning to?
- What do you do for fun?

#### Example:

> Hi! I am Jeff, one of the two instructors for this course. I am an Assistant Professor of quantitative and clinical psychology at the University of Kansas (in Lawrence, Kansas, USA). I study affective and interpersonal functioning and how technology can be used to improve research in the social and medical sciences. I am interested in using machine learning to recognize facial expressions from images and to predict emotional states and mental health status from clinical data. For fun, I bring my 100 lb labrador/pyrenhees mix to the dog park or read sci-fi/fantasy novels.
